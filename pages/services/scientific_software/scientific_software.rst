`Uetke <https://www.uetke.com>`_ specializes in the development of highly specific software for the lab. Many laboratories face a bottleneck when software turns into a handicap instead of a tool for performing experiments. However, few Ph.D. and postdocs have the knowledge and the time to sit down and program the tools they need to automatize tasks or to develop a proper user interface for visualizing the experiment in real-time. Leveraging from Uetke's expertise, labs around the world can cut down development times and focus into the science questions they want to answer.

We work in close collaboration both with lab managers as well as with younger researchers. In this way, we can fulfill the requests for the long-term view of the lab and those that arise from the daily use of the software. Our experience allows us to lay out a development environment that will be sustainable not only in the short term. Our software is properly documented and designed in such a way that future users can expand its functionality without complications.

Applications of our software range from controlling optical tweezers to fast acquisition of digital cameras. We have also developed solutions to control confocal microscopes for single-molecule microscopy and to perform high-speed tracking of nano-particles. There are no problems we cannot solve, `contact us <https://www.uetke.com/contact>`_ to discuss what the possibilities are. If you are writing an application and you need help with the instrumentation section, we can assist you with the process. Don't let a good idea for an experiment to be limited by the software you have available.

A common example of how software can improve the throughput of your experiment is by automation. There are many tasks that don't need to be performed manually by a scientist. For example, you may want to acquire an emission spectrum every a certain amount of time but you need to refocus your microscope to compensate for drifts. Customized software can do this without a lot of trouble, on one hand freeing researchers time to do creative work, on the other lowering the bias that manual selection can introduce into data. The result will be an increase in the amount of collected data, leading to better statistics as well as more reproducible results.

Uetke bases all the development on **open source** projects, delivering software that can be easily audited. This ensures the reproducibility and traceability of results. Data is always stored with identification headers that will enable future researchers to know the exact experimental conditions that lead to specific conclusions. You will be able to know not only when data was generated, but also who the scientist running the experiment was, what were the parameters used in the measurement and everything that you may request. The scientific community is slowly requesting open access to data in order to reproduce results and check the algorithms used for analyzing them. Software used for performing the experiment will soon follow this trend and Uetke's software is prepared for it.

The delivery of software can be complemented with `courses for researchers <https://www.uetke.com/courses>`_. These courses will set both young and seasoned researchers into the fast-track of software development. If you are planning to expand the software developed by Uetke at a later stage, or you want to give users complete control over the software that was delivered, the courses provided by Uetke are ideal. Uetke is the only company that provides both software and training based on open source projects, done by researchers for researchers.
