:og_description: A child project to share ideas and learn from each other

It is finally time to present a child project of Uetke: `Python For The Lab <https://forum.pythonforthelab.com>`_, a place to share ideas relating to the use of Python in the lab. **Python for the Lab** was born out of the necessity to provide a continuous place to exchange ideas. There are no other website where Python users can interact with each other in a friendly environment, with a low entry barrier. It doesn't matter if you have doubts, if you want to ask for opinions regarding your experiment or your software. Everything is welcome.

After a lot of different trials, we found a great solution: Discourse. It is a discussion platform, easy to host on any web server. Easy to maintain and with a neat design. Perhaps the interface is familiar to you from other websites. If not, you will find it incredibly intuitive. Of course, you are always welcome to ask if you have any doubts, that is why we have created the website.

We are looking forward to engaging the community, so feel free to post your first messages on the topics that you want. Ask questions, write down experiences or advertise your packages. With time, the community will start finding its own way.
