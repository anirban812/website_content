Because of the great amount of interest our courses started to receive, we have added dates for the Git for Scientists course. They will be held at `Meet Berlage <https://goo.gl/maps/iZbmEs4mQL32>`_, an awesome location just 5 minutes away from Amsterdam Centraal Station. The sessions will be held on **Tuesday 17th of April and Monday 23rd**, and they last the entire day. **Lunch will be provided**.

The courses are hands-on from the beginning; you will learn from a realistic perspective how to work with git and its different web implementations such as BitBucket, GitHub, and GitLab. You will have a clear perspective on how to manage a repository, how to collaborate and how to exploit to your advantage all the options that git has.

You will not work alone, but in groups; therefore you will experience from first hand all the different aspects involved with version control, both as the owner of a repository and as a collaborator. This will give you a clear insight into what happens at every step of the development cycle.

We will not limit ourselves to code, we will discuss how you can collaborate on a paper, or how you can use Git for automatically backing up your thesis. More importantly, we will discuss what rules to establish that will give long-term prosperity to the repositories, regardless of the number of participants that they have.

If there are enough time and interest, by the end of the course we will discuss how to document Python code in order to build online documentation thanks to ReadTheDocs.

**Requirements for the course**: you will need to bring your own laptop. You will receive instructions on how to setup git on your computer some days prior to the course; this will save us time the first day.  **No programming skills are needed**.
