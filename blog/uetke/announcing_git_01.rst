We are launching the course *Git for Scientists* aimed at researchers from different backgrounds and career stages. In the course, you will learn how to work with git, one of the best version control system of all times, and its different web implementations such as BitBucket, GitHub, and GitLab.

Git is essential if you are collaborating on a research project, or simply working on your own on separate machines. In Git for Scientists, you will learn how to manage a repository, how to collaborate, and how to exploit all the options that git has. You will work in groups, therefore you will experience all the different aspects involved with version control, both as the owner of a repository and as a collaborator. This will give you a clear insight into what happens at every step of the development cycle.

We will not limit ourselves to use git for coding, we will also discuss how to use git while collaborating on the writing of a  scientific paper or for automatically backing up your thesis. Additionally, we will discuss what rules you should establish to ensure long-term prosperity to your repositories. Finally, if there are enough interest and time, we will discuss how to build online software documentation using `ReadTheDocs <https://readthedocs.org>`_.

The course Git for Scientist will be held on **Tuesday 17th of April and Monday 23rd**, from 10 am to 5 pm at Meet Berlage, an awesome location just 5 minutes away from Amsterdam Centraal Station. Lunch will be provided.

**Requirements**: you will need to bring your own laptop. Days prior to the course you will receive instructions on how to install git on your computer. No programming skills are needed.
